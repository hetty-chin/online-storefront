node.js and MySQL
## MySQL Database
In a .sql I created a database and in it I added a table, then I altered the table to begin the SKU at 100 rather than 1, because when do you ever see an SKU that starts at 1? 
In that table I added 10 random objects in various departments. 
## js
I set up a js to require mysql then I configured the mysql connection, updating my sql username and setting it to read the database I created. 
Then I connected to my sql database. I set up a function, so that after it connects, the terminal will display all of the items found in my table. 
I installed npm mysql and ran the js to confirm that it displays everything on the table and it did.
